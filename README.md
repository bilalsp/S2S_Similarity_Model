# SENTENCE TO SENTENCE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY

Abstract: There are many methods available to compare words based on the context and the meaning, which convert the word into a representation in an n-dimensional vector space which is referred to as word embedding. Some of the methods are word2vec invented by Tomas Mikolov at Google, Glove from Stanford, and fastTest from Facebook. But, extending the notion of word similarity to complete sentence semantic similarity is one of the toughest problems in the Natural Language Processing(NLP). In this project, we build the system to compute the semantic similarity between two english sentences/questions using the Support Vector Machine(SVM). We consider the multiple similarities like literal similarity, shallow syntactic similarity, and latent semantic similarity as explanatory variables to predict the semantic similarity between two sentences. Our system predicts whether two sentences are duplicate or not based on the intent of the sentences.
